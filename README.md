Hi, I, Shamonte Knight, welcome you.
Here, we could be building at the edge of art, engineering, and identity. This repo is the evolving archive of real, living projects that blend utility and design.
I successfully manage my ai's to build/code, with my finger and ideas!!
That means you can too!


I implement -> test -> design -> then share the magic!
